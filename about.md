# About Smile Sleigh

## Our Vision
To bring festive smiles to women and children impacted by domestic abuse across Surrey and Hampshire.

## About Us

Smile Sleigh was established in 2019 by Sophie East. The initiative was started to bring a smile during the festive season to **women and children affected by domestic abuse**. Through the simple act of giving a gift, Sophie wanted to ensure that, despite the impact of the domestic abuse on their lives, the **women and children felt valued** and in others’ thoughts.

From humble beginnings, where Sophie collected donated gifts for the local refuge, Smile Sleigh has grown into an **invaluable support service** for domestic abuse refuges and outreach services across Surrey and Hampshire. Now in its 6th year, Smile Sleigh is as strong as ever, with ambitions to **reach even more vulnerable families**. We provide brand new **age-appropriate gifts for children.** and carefully curated **wellness packs** for women.

Smile Sleigh is a local initiative relying purely on the generosity of **people and businesses in the local area.** We have a **dedicated volunteer network** who come together to lend their time and expertise to bring a moment of joy to the women and children affected by domestic abuse in our community

## Why Support Us
Smile Sleigh isn’t just about festive giving. There is a very serious reason behind the initiative. 1 in 4 women experience domestic abuse during their
lifetime. Eight women a month are killed by a current or former partner in England and Wales and over 100,000 children live in homes where there is
high-risk domestic abuse**. By partnering with Smile Sleigh you are having a direct and positive impact on the women and children in your local area
affected by domestic abuse.
We can provide print and marketing collateral, collect donations directly from you and provide any additional information you need to get started.
