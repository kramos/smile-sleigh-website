    <span class="text">It really is the most wonderful initiative. The <b>joy this brings our families</b> at SWS refuge is immeasurable. Some families come to us with nothing and the added pressure of trying to provide gifts for their children at <b>Christmas can be overwhelming.</b> It really isn’t the size of the gift it is <b>the feeling someone has thought about them</b> when they are often missing family and friends because they have been moved to a safe area.  Many thanks Smile Sleigh for your awesome work

    <span class="text">With the voucher from you I got him an Alexa speaker clock and some trump cards. He was speechless and kept saying where’s my mum gone?  Before I didn’t like things that listen in, that a perpetrator could use to record or spy on me, but I said to him this is your new mum that was always there before. Please pass on <b>how very grateful I was for the vouchers and how much of a difference and happiness they made.</b> <br/><strong>- Mum of recipient</strong></span>
