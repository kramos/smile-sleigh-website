It’s just incredible, and I feel so warm and fuzzy, actually teary about it. You and your wonderful team have been such a lifeline to the children and me. Lots of love to you all.

    <span class="text">My child feels so special because it’s her first time receiving this kind of gifts, and not just one but more than that. She was very happy opening all her presents. She loved all of it, thank you.

    <span class="text">With the voucher from you I got him an Alexa speaker clock and some trump cards. He was speechless and kept saying 'where’s my mum gone?' Before, I didn’t like things that listen in, but I said to him this is your new mum that was always there before. Please pass on how very grateful I was for the vouchers and how much of a difference and happiness they made.
